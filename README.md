# My_Digital_Wallet
Digital Wallet that aim to execute an instrument following a specific protocol. The Service will offer an open API, a GUI for the end User and a backend processing solution in charge of handling Batch Transactions coming from different producers. 
For the PoC, the solution will be handling only one geographical zone (Hong Kong) and only one currency (US Dollar).
Nevertheless, the producers can differ and send different types of transactions.
Resiliancy, Maintenability and Fault Tolerance would be a priority for this solution.

## Technology
In order to develop a scalable and fast Service, the Technological Stack will be based on Amazon Web Services. This choice is crucial for the potential deployment over different regions and currencies.

## Targets
A digital wallet is linked into an end-user, bank, or vendor application and provides the application with instrument management and protocol management services.
The Digital Wallet will provide a GUI for the End-User, the first version will be a web application.
Providing a SAAS would simplify the process of keeping protocol and software up to date.

## Vision
The project aims to be used with another project that I am building: a Payment Gateway.
