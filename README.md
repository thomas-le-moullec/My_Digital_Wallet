# My_Digital_Wallet
Digital Wallet that aim to execute an instrument following a specific protocol. 

## Targets
A digital wallet is linked into an end-user, bank, or vendor application and provides the application with instrument management and protocol management services.
The Digital Wallet will provide a GUI for the End-User, the first version will be a web application.
Providing a SAAS would simplify the process of keeping protocol and software up to date.

## Vision
The project aims to be used with another project that I am building: a Payment Gateway.
